# PrimeGap

A simple C Program that prints prime gaps. I couldn't sleep one night so I made this.

## Ways I could turn this into a valuable use of my time:

* [x] Add full support for 64-bit arithmetic
* [ ]Add a bunch of different primality checking algorithms to the mix so I can do performance comparisons
* [ ]Find a way to make it multi-threaded
* [ ]Rewrite the whole thing in C++ because trying to write software in pure C in 2017 is a waste of my time anyways
* [ ]Rewrite the whole thing in Haskell and do a performance comparison (so I can finally get around to using Haskell)


It's pretty useless right now, but if you just need just a piece of dummy software that produces an output based on an input to test the galaxy's next greatest JS framework or something, then it might be useful to you. Since prime gaps don't really have a definite pattern, it could maybe be of use as a data set for something. If you want something slowly increasing while exhibiting "random" growth patterns, this could be useful to you as well.
